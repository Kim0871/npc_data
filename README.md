# [NPC Data](https://github.com/Kim0871/npc_data)
###### 2025-P2 EFREI | TRAN Kim-Lan & LOESCH Thomas

This project aims to build a structured database for storing information about Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) in fantasy games. We took strong inspiration from Dungeons & Dragons, a game that provides a rich framework for character development. In addition to NPCs, our database includes elements such as Locations, Items, and Quests to nourish our database with more immersive and plausible in-game scenarios.
